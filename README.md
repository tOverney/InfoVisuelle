# InfoVisuelle

# To run our marvelous project
    simply run the compile.sh script which is in the imageprocessing folder.
    If you don't have processing installed via brew (highly probable);
    Just give the path to your processing core.jar as first argument to the script.

# Avoiding Quad drawing
    there is one line to comment in the draw method (which has a comment with 
    this very same message).

# Running on another image
    Kidding! There's nothing special to do, just change the image name in the
    attribute list at the begning on the ImageProcessing class. 

# Quad selection
    This part is a bit messy! We have yet to fix it.

# Thank you
    For taking the time and grading us.
    Best,
    Team I
